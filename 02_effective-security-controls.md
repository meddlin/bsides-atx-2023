# Mind the Gap: are your security controls effective

No matter the assessment, the common vulnerability is "questionably effective controls". Namely from people creating workarounds to get what they need done, and the controls didn't anticipate.


(Overall, this talk is a bit basic...but the fundamentals here can be repackaged and applied to developers.)


## Expectation vs Reality

- Ex: like a Pinterest project fail, lol. This is what we're avoiding.

- Consider the end-users might not have the same perspective as seeing "the whole" of security
    - so they're creating workarounds to still get what they need done


## Why do they occur?

- Productivity
    - ex: EMTs taking pictures of patient IDs, before administering life-saving care, to enter the PII later into hospital computer(s)
- too strict/not strict enough
- above the users' technical abilities
    - ex: end-user sees a "file share" option to keep files secure, but they instead continue to use unencrypted email


## Identify

- have a conversation with your end users
- ask about their day-to-day
- take interest in their job (let them be the expert)
    - ask: is there anywhere security makes things too restrictive
    - ask: who do you go to for help? (this might be a peer, instead of a helpdesk, dept., etc.) Sometimes these "first line SMEs" are the people (champion) who create the workaround in the first place
    - ask: are there any other areas you're concerned about security?
- probe at problem areas
    - in your support data, check on things; is it being used as intended?
    - still check on your metrics


## Remediate

1. Discuss Concerns
2. Collaborate
3. Document

- Repeat 1. 
- How can you reframe things in the context of security for someone?


## Prevent

- Engage Leadership (Executive Buy-in)
    - modern talking points (news headlines) is making this eaiser, but it's still a crucial step
    - because if a boss isn't taking security seriously, then the employees aren't taking it seriously either
- Policy enforcement
    - review this on a regular basis
- Share secuirty responsibility
    - make sure everyone knows their obligation, and what they're responsibility (i.e. contribution) is to making security better
    - Show them how following a compliance is them helping



## Extra Points

- Make sure all of your documentation is in ONE LOCATION
    - This can help people know where their policies are. So they know where to answer their own questions.
